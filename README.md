# The-Awesome-Emily-Debate-Initiative

## About us
TAEDI is a non-profit debate initiative focused on creating an amazing debate experience for children. Yep. And get them into university. And manipulate parents. And to just create a fun experience overall.

## This repo
This repo contains the website files, ready-to-host _(not: the creator of these files is terrible at anything related to making the hosting provider actually server the website including the JS & CSS and not just the HTML)_.

## Me
Yes. I am Kingston. Bye.
